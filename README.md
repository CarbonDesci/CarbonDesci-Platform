# CarbonDesci Platform

A decentralized platform for environmental science research and carbon credit management.

## Overview

CarbonDesci Platform is a Web3-enabled platform that connects environmental researchers, data contributors, and stakeholders in the carbon credit ecosystem. The platform facilitates:

- Research proposal submission and funding
- Environmental data collection and validation
- Carbon credit token (CCT) management
- Decentralized governance for research funding

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web3.js for blockchain integration
- React Router for navigation

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT for authentication

### Smart Contracts
- Solidity
- Hardhat for development
- OpenZeppelin for standard contracts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- MetaMask wallet
- Git
